Since returning to London. my colleague Jackie Pontin and l have given more
thought to how best to capitalize upon the studies on high and low familial risl: of
lung cancer which are just being set up with Henry Lynch. since Dr. Lynch will be

such is my conviction that i believe these studies should be started immediately and
notconstrcinedbymymovetoliewcastie. I-lercismypropossl:

Omnhn will be recruiting 400 subjects. each pheeotyped with debrisooeine in viva :
they will fall into four groups oi‘ equal sine; sporadic lung cancers with no other
cancer family history ('low' risk), sporadic lung cancers with positive cancer family
history. colon ccncsrprone families with high and low family histories. These
latter two types of pedigree are very interesting from the following point oi‘ view.

future resource for studying the molecular genetics of lung cancer risk. We are
already looking in cohorts with eDNA probes and RPLP _nnalysis for various P450
polymorphisms which we believe may bear upon lung cancer risk. At relatively
small ndditionni cost (supplemented by CTR?) Dr. Lynch could mnil us small batches
