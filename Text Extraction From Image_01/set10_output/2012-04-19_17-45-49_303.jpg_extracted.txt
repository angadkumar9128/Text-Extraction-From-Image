Dear Charlie.

Since returning to London, my colleague Jackie Pontin and I have given more
thought to how best to capitalize upon the studies on high and low familial risk of
lung cancer which Ire just being set up with Henry Lynch‘ Since Dr. Lynch will be
liking the trouble of mounting the field studies in various types of 'high“ and “low”
risk cancer pedigrees, I feel strongly that we should not miss the opportunity of
eltnbllshing immortal cell lines on each of the 400 subjects which we will study.
Such is my conviction that I believe these studies should be started immediately and
not constrained by my move to Newcastle. Here is my proposal:

Onuhn will be recruiting 400 subjects, each phenotyped with debrisoquine in viva :
they will fall into four groups of equal size; sporadic lung cancers with no other
cancer fnmily history (‘low" risk), sporadic lung cancers with positive cancer family
history. colon cancer-prone families with high and low family histories. These
letter two types of pedigree are very interesting from the following point of view,
that of the 2000 members of the 10 kindreds, there is only one known case of lung
cancer. lmmorulized EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid B-cell lines will provide a
future resource for studying the molecular genetics of lung cancer risk. We are
already looking in cohort: with cDNA probes and RPLP_analysis for various P450

lymorphisnu which we believe may bear upon lung cancer risk. At relatively
small tdditlonal cost (supplemented by CTR?) Dr. Lynch could mail us small batches
of fresh blood for B~cell transformation. I cannot see how this should add more
than thou! S5 to the cost of each sample collection, or $2000 in low. but he needs to
be asked. At our end we shall need Ms. Pontin’s salary with on—costs. ($45,000 for
ll months) together with consumable costs for cell transformation, culture and
cryopreservntion of $75 per cell line (cf. $500 NIH contracted - out cost!), 1.2.
$30,000. In addition, we would need to purchase a liquid nitrogen Dewar for
etorln; the cell line: (H600). The total cost of the project for the first yczr would
thus be $51,600 (2/3 $45,000 + 2/3 530,000 + 31,600).
